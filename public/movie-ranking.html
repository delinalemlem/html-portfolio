<h3>The Night Agent</h3>
<p>Shawn Ryan produced the American action thriller TV series The Night Agent, which is based on Matthew Quirk's novel of the same name. It aired on Netflix on March 23, 2023, and stars Gabriel Basso in the title character. The narrative is that FBI agent Peter Sutherland is drawn into a massive conspiracy involving a mole at the top levels of the US government. To preserve the nation, he embarks on a desperate search for the traitor, while sheltering former tech CEO Rose Larkin from the individuals who murdered her aunt and uncle.</p>
<h3>The Stranger</h3>

<p>The story twists in Harlan Coben's novels are always excellent. Adam Price has a lot to lose: a happy marriage to a lovely woman, two gorgeous sons, and all the trappings of the American Dream: a large house, a nice career, and a seemingly perfect existence.
    Then he meets the Stranger. When he discovers a tragic secret about his wife, Corinne, he confronts her, and the illusion of perfection vanishes as if it never existed at all. Adam quickly finds himself entangled in something considerably deeper than even Corinne's deception, and understands that if he doesn't make exactly the correct moves, the plot he's stumbled into will not only damage livesâ€”it will end them. </p>

<h3>Hold tight</h3>
<p>Anything written by Harlan Coben is something I could watch all day every day. I mean, I always enjoy the story twists; you never know how it will end. Holdtight is another fantastic series that I enjoy. When a young guy goes missing shortly after his friend dies, life in a tight-knit, affluent Warsaw suburb progressively unravels, revealing secrets and falsehoods. </p>
