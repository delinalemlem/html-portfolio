<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Delina. I work as a website developer. To be completely honest, I'm still not used to saying, "I'm a web developer," because I was in a really bad place in my life not long ago. I was a person with no career who nearly gave up on life because I didn't see the point of it. I had lost interest in life in general, and nothing made sense to me. I just wanted to die. My life did not fill me with satisfaction. Although several factors contributed to how I felt, one was a lack of stability in my life and profession.There were many instances when I cried ceaselessly all day and night because I was unhappy with my life, despite the fact that I appeared to be happy to others. No one would have guessed I was in an unimaginably bad mental state. But, thank God, I'm a different person today.  </p>

<p> Today, I am relieved to tell that I am no longer in that dark period of my life and have begun to live a little; slowly but steadily, I am discovering happiness within myself. I'm not sure how I initially became interested in coding, but I knew I'd always had a desire to create and build things, and God led me there. It's enjoyable and fascinating, yet not simple. I began attending online web development programs and learning on my own. </p>

<p>I just want to remind everyone who is going through a difficult phase to be kind to themselves. Expectation kills; constantly consider whether someone else would survive if they had the same life and experiences as you. You are strong, and only you know what you have conquered, so never give up hope and remember that every day is a new opportunity. Nobody else can help you get out of this dark hole except yourself, so get up and start living; you are beautiful and worthy. You can do it; if I can do it, you can as well, and I believe in you.  </p>
